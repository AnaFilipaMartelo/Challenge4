# Evaluating Risk and Return Metrics for Investment Selection

This Python-based analysis tool empowers you to assess the investment potential of four carefully selected funds managed by renowned fund and hedge-fund managers, often referred to as "whales" in the financial industry. With the help of key risk-management metrics, including daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas, you can make informed decisions to identify the fund with the most promising investment prospects. With this Jupyter notebook, you will be able to perform comprehensive data preparation, analysis, and visualization of the selected funds' risk and return metrics. With these in-depth assessments you'll be able to extract valuable insights from the provided datasets.
